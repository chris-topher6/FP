\section{Aims of the Experiment}
\label{sec:aims}
The primary aim of the experiment is to determine the Debye temperature $\theta_D$ of copper. 
This will be achieved by measuring the isobaric specific heat capacity $C_p$ of the material. 
The Debye temperature is a fundamental characteristic of a crystalline solid, 
representing the temperature above which all modes of lattice vibration are excited.
