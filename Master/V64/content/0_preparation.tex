\subsection*{What does coherence mean?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item phaserelation of waves
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Familiarise yourself with the terms on degree of coherence, temporal coherence an dspatial coherence.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item temporal: consistency of phase over time 
    \item spatial: 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What are the ifferent polarisation properties of light?}
\subsection*{How must two light beams be polarised in relation to each other so that interference effects can be observed?}

\subsection*{How can the contrast (also visibility) of an interferometer be defined?}

\subsection*{How does a polarising beam-spliter cube (PBSC) work?}
\subsection*{Which orientation has the polarisation of the outcoming light beam of the PBSC, if the polarisation of the incoming light beam lies in the vertical and the PBSC is titled at $\SI{45}{\degree}$ away from the vertical?}

\subsection*{Show that the maximum intensity $I_\text{max}$ in case of constructive interference respectively the minimal intensity $I_\text{min}$ in case of deconstructive interferene, detected by a diode is given by:}
\begin{equation*}
    I_\text{max/min}\propto I_\text{Laser}(1\pm2\cos\phi\sin\phi)
\end{equation*}
\subsection*{Explain why this assumption about the detected diode signal in justified.}
\subsection*{What is the significance of the variable $\delta$?}
\subsection*{What is the relationship between $I_\text{Laser}$, $\phi$ and the electric field component $E_i$}

\subsection*{How does the contrast depend on the polarisation angle?}

\subsection*{Which kind of measurement uses one and which  two diodes?}
\subsection*{What is the advantage of measuring the differential voltage of both diodes (differential voltage method)?}

\subsection*{How can you determine the refraction index $n$ depend on temperature $T$ and the pressure $p$ of a gas (Lorentz-Lorenz-law)?}
