\section{Aims of the Experiment}
\label{sec:aims}
The primary objective of this experiment is to ascertain 
the refractive indices of both glass and air. To achieve this,
a Sagnac interferometer is employed. This device's
design and operating principles enable precise measurement 
of refractive indices.
