\section{Aims of the Experiment}
The objective of V61 is to conduct a comprehensive investigation
of a Helium-Neon (HeNe) laser. This involves the analysis of two 
transverse electromagnetic (TEM) modes and the evaluation of its 
stability conditions. Additionally, it encompasses the determination
the laser's polarization state and wavelength.
