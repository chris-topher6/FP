\section{Aims of the Experiment}
The goal of V61 is to comprehensively study a Helium-Neon (HeNe) laser.
This entails the examination of two Transverse Electromagnetic (TEM) modes 
and the assessment of the stability condition. Furthermore, it involves 
the determination of the laser's polarisation state and wavelength.
