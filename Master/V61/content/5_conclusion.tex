\section{Conclusion}
The stability condition could not be completely tested, as the length of the optical
bench was reached before the theoretical maximum in the first measurement and the
adjustment of the laser could not be done optimally in the second measurement. In both
cases, the theoretical boundary could not be reached.
\\
The measurement of the TEM-Modes could be done sufficiently, as both fits show little
deviation from the measured data. The uncertainties in the fit parameters as well as
the estimated measurement uncertainty of $\sigma_{I} = \SI{0.09}{\micro\ampere}$ are at most
$\SI{2.4}{\percent}$.
\\
The polarisation of the laser shows the expected periodicity of $2\pi$ with the fit
deviating only slightly from the data, which was most likely caused by fluctuations
which made reading the instrument more difficult. The slight...
