\section{Conclusion}
The measurements align closely with the theoretical predictions. 
The threshold current exhibited clear discreteness, initiating 
visible laser operation.

\noindent
The absorption spectrum meets expectations, with all four minima 
clearly visible. This indicates successful avoidance of mode hopping. 
The triangular background from the generator was effectively removed 
by balancing the signal from both detectors, as described in Section 
\ref{sec:rubidium}. This resulted in the flat line observed between 
the minima in Figure \ref{fig:spectrum_1}.

\noindent
One challenge encountered during the measurements was the sensitivity 
of the laser's alignment to minor mechanical disturbances. Any 
imprecise adjustment led to disruptions in the measurements.
