\section{Experimental Setup and Measurements}
\label{sec:procedure}
\noindent
A germanium detector, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:detector}, 
and a radioactive source are placed inside a lead case, which 
provides shielding.

\noindent
Each measurement lasts for $\SI{45}{\minute}$. For detector 
calibration, a sample of $^{152}\text{Eu}$ with well known activity
is measured.

\noindent
After the calibration, the spectra of $^{137}\text{Cs}$ and 
$^{60}\text{Co}$ samples are measured. Additionally, the spectrum 
of an unknown sample is measured.

\noindent
To estimate background radiation during the measurements, a 
measurement without any sample is conducted over $\SI{24}{\hour}$.
